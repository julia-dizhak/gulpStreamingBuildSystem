          <p>Gulp is a streaming JS build system built with node.js; it leverages the power of streams and code-over-configuration to automate, organize, and run development tasks very quickly and efficiently</p>
          <p>Node.js commonly referred to as node, is a powerful Js platform that is built on top of Google Chrome's Js runtime engine, V8. This give us the ability to write Js code on a server, or in our case, on local machine</p>
          <p>Node.js ships with npm, a companion package manager that facilitates the installation, storage, and creation of modular components that you can use to create applications.</p>
